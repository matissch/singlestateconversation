Multiple chatbot instances can be created per chatbot type (e.g. a health coach for user X and user Y, and a learning assistant for user P and user Q). Both, types and instances are stored with and referenced by an ID (e.g. a UUID) in the database.\n",

      "[\"Thank you for reaching out for a review and optimization of your investment portfolio. As an expert in portfolio management, specializing in diversified investments, I'd be happy to assist you.\\n\\nTo start, it would be helpful to have some additional information about your current portfolio, such as the asset classes, allocation percentages, investment goals, and risk tolerance. This will help me tailor my recommendations to align with your specific needs.\\n\\nThat being said, I can provide you with some general insights on optimizing a diversified investment portfolio based on the current market conditions.\\n\\n1. Review your asset allocation: Take a closer look at your allocation across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments. Assess whether it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Keep in mind that diversification across various asset classes can help mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns.\\n\\n2. Focus on risk management: Given the current market volatility and global uncertainties, it's crucial to emphasize risk management in your portfolio. Consider incorporating assets that historically have low correlations to each other, as this can help reduce the overall risk of your portfolio.\\n\\n3. Stay informed about market trends: Regularly review the macroeconomic environment and be aware of market trends. This will enable you to make informed decisions and potentially take advantage of market opportunities. Keep up with the latest news, economic indicators, and expert opinions to improve your investment outcomes.\\n\\n4. Assess your individual holdings: Evaluate each individual investment within your portfolio. Review their historical performance, management team, fees, and the future outlook of the respective sectors or industries they operate in. Consider diversifying investments within each asset class to further enhance portfolio diversification.\\n\\n5. Rebalance regularly: As market conditions change, your portfolio's asset allocation may drift from its original allocation. Periodic rebalancing ensures that your portfolio stays in line with your desired risk-return profile. It involves selling portions of the overperforming assets and reinvesting in underperforming or undervalued assets.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that the suggestions provided here are general in nature and may not be suitable for everyone. It is always recommended to consult with a professional financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.\\n\\nCould you please provide more details about your current portfolio, investment goals, and risk tolerance? This will enable me to provide more tailored optimization recommendations.\"]\n"
